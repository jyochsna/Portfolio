           My name is Jyochsna Gongal. I  live in Mountain House , Ca. Originally I am from Nepal.  This portfolio represents my work and achievements throughout my coding bootcamp career. I did my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Nepal. And worked as a System Engineer for about two years.
           <br><br>
           Beside engineering I love cooking foods and doing some DIY crafts with my daughter. This is also one of the reason I choose to be a developer so that I can make my own Food Blog with some of my own food recipes.<br><br>
           Being a developer means I will be learning everyday which will definitely helps me in my career path.
